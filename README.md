# EV_Dekho
Ev_Dekho is a full-stack web application project built using Node.js, Express.js, EJS, MongoDB, Mongoose, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, Passport, Bcrypt, and other packages/technologies.

Various functionalities have been mentioned below:

1. Users can register to access the home page by providing their credentials. The Passport package is used to validate passwords. They are also allowed to log out from the home page.

2. Admins can log in/register by providing their credentials. The Bcrypt package is used to validate passwords.

3. Admins can add vehicle entries like speed, vehicle name, company, range, photo, etc. Admins can also delete and update vehicle entries. Database entries are modified using Mongoose operations.

4. Users can explore electric vehicles by specifying their requirements such as price range, speed, etc. Users can also view details, specifications, the vehicle's photo, and reviews. This is accomplished using EJS and Mongoose operations.

5. Users can compare 2 or 3 electric vehicles side by side. Users can also filter out the comparision by selecting the comparision criteria. Again it is done using EJS, mongoose and javascript.

6. Users can calculate their savings if they switch to an EV from their petrol/diesel vehicle. They will also be able to calculate the carbon footprint they leave behind and how it can be reduced by switching to EVs. This is accomplished using a custom algorithm, EJS, and JavaScript.

7. The recently viewed vehicles of the users and the total user count are also displayed on the home page. Again, this is done using EJS and Mongoose operations.
